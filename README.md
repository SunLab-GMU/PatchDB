# PatchDB: A Large-Scale Security Patch Dataset

## Description

To foster large-scale research on vulnerability mitigation and to enable a comparison of different detection approaches, we make our dataset ***PatchDB*** from our DSN21 paper publicly available. 

PatchDB is a large-scale security patch dataset that contains around 12K security patches and 24K non-security patches from the real world. 
You can find more details on the dataset in the paper *"[PatchDB: A Large-Scale Security Patch Dataset](https://shuwang127.github.io/papers/dsn21_PatchDB.pdf)"*. You can also visit our [PatchDB official website](https://sunlab-gmu.github.io/PatchDB) for more information.
